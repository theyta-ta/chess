calling it a day here.

currently implementing checks (and therefore also checkmate) and castling.
all i really need to do is 

havent added castling, checks, checkmate, algebraic notation input,
en-passant, 50-move rule,  or ex/importing FEN/PGN yet.

that is probably the order ill add them in though.

theres also probably lotsa bugs :D
